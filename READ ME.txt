Gamma Knife annual QA automated filmless profile processing code for PTW MicroDiamond and SNC PC Electrometer

1. Install miniconda (or anaconda) at https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. 
2. From miniconda or anaconda prompt (or cmd, if conda added to PATH), naviate to profile code directory
3.a. Create a conda environment using the gk-profiles.yml file using "conda env create --name NAME --file gk-profiles.yml" (not necessary if you've previously created an environment to run this code.
3.b. Activate the environment using "conda activate NAME". You can list conda environments with "conda info --envs".
4. With LGP DICOMs and measurements in the appropriate directories, run "python read_lgp.py" from the anaconda prompt to read the DICOM data and store them as numpy arrays. This only needs to be done once.
5. run "python profiles.py" to plot LGP and measured profiles and create an output PDF. Some settings, such as whether to use linear interpolation or a support vector machine for profile fitting, can be adjusted in the first few lines of profiles.py.
