# Gamma Knife profiles with PCE and MicroDiamond diode
A project to read SNC PC Electrometer time-resolved data and create, display, and compare Gamma Knife profiles with LGP beam model. Reference dose distribution for 4, 8, and 16 mm dose distributions is expected in DICOM format under LGP/dcm/ -- NYU profiles are stored in NumPy arrays. All measurements for this work were taken with PTW MicroDiamond at determined intervals +/- 2 cm from origin in a QA plan.
